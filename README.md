# Smart Water Quality Monitoring System

## Overview
The Smart Water Quality Monitoring System is designed to implement a water purity
monitoring system using a turbidity sensor, Arduino, and LCD
display. The system measures the turbidity of water in NTU
(Nephelometric Turbidity Units), displays the result on an LCD, and
triggers an LED and buzzer alarm when the water is unsafe for
drinking. By integrating sensor data with intelligent processing, the system helps detect contamination early and supports efficient water resource management.

## Objectives
- Monitors key water quality parameter like turbidity
- This project provides a low-cost, real-time water
purity check.  
- Improve reliability compared to manual testing  
- Enable data-driven decision making for water safety  

## Key Features
- Real-time monitoring  
- Sensor-based data acquisition  
- Automated analysis  
- Scalable architecture  
- Suitable for residential, industrial, and environmental applications  

## tools
